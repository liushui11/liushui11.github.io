            <p>Dance is a science that takes dance art as the research object and conducts comprehensive, systematic and historical research on the special social phenomenon of dance. For the study of dance, in fact, it is necessary to comprehensively, systematically and scientifically figure out "what is dance?" "That's the question. In the past, some people once ridiculed us dancers as "well-developed limbs and simple brains"; There are also artists who say that we dancers "lack understanding...... Maybe it's because we have some dancers who only dance and don't know or can't clearly answer "What is dance?" </p>
            <p>According to the classification of art, dance is a type of art, and dance must have the essence of art. The definition of art is simply as follows: art is a social phenomenon that uses actions, gestures, lines, colors, sounds, languages, words, etc. as means of expression to create a specific and vivid image that can be perceived, reflecting the aesthetic attributes of social life, and expressing the author's aesthetic evaluation and aesthetic ideals of social life. It is a form in which people understand and reflect social life from an aesthetic perspective, express people's emotions and thoughts, and are the concentrated embodiment of people's aesthetic relationship with the real world. Dance is a kind of art, so it must have the essential attributes of art and be restricted by its artistic commonality.
