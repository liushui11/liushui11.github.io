          <h3>10508NAT - Musical Theatre and Commercial Dance</h3>
          <p>Theatre dance is a synthesis of dance movements, character dialogues, and lyrics, requiring performers to dance in accordance with the characters in the play and to be able to complete the tasks of the drama in the dance. Theater dance involves a variety of dance types, and the choreographer chooses the use of dance elements according to the needs of the plot, which is an indispensable part of the musical, often plays a role in promoting the development of the storyline of the musical, and is a compulsory course for musical theater actors.</p>
          <h3>21685VIC - Classical Dance</h3>
          <p>It is generally referred to as ballet. Ballet is a transliteration of the French Ballet. Classical dance dramas in European countries are collectively known as ballet, which is a kind of dance variety that uses European classical dance as the main means of expression and integrates music, drama, stage art and other art forms. It is commonly known as "pointe dancing" because an important feature of the performance technique is that the actress wears special pointe dancing shoes and dances on pointe. According to legend, ballet first originated in Italy, formed in France, and was introduced to Russia in the 18th century. It became an independent and complete art form at the end of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth century, creating pointe dance techniques, developing various aerial jumping and spinning techniques, and producing a complete set of training methods, gradually forming the Italian, French and Russian schools with different stylistic characteristics. After the 20s of the 20th century, modern ballet schools appeared, and many ballet schools were derived one after another, which became popular in Europe and the United States. [3]</p>
